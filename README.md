# weekly-weather
A weather dashboard including a 5-day forecast using data from a third-party weather API.

## What I Learned
In this project I learned to fetch data from a third-party API and implement that data into a useful application. I stumbled on printing/rendering this data to my webpage, but found it easier to structure the elements in Javascript after first building out what was needed first in the HTML file.
